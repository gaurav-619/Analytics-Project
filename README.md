# Marketing Analytics Platform

## Overview

The Marketing Analytics Platform is an end-to-end Analytics Engineering project built using Google BigQuery, dbt, Python, and AI-powered reporting.

The project transforms raw marketing, customer, campaign, product, and transaction data into trusted business-ready datasets that support reporting, experimentation analysis, customer analytics, and executive decision-making.

The platform demonstrates modern Analytics Engineering practices including:

* Data Warehousing with BigQuery
* Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
* dbt Transformations
* Incremental Processing
* Historical Snapshots
* Automated Data Quality Testing
* Business Intelligence Reporting
* AI-Powered Executive Insights

## Business Problem

Marketing and business teams often struggle to answer important questions because data is fragmented across multiple sources and lacks a governed analytics layer.

This platform was designed to answer questions such as:

* Which campaigns generate the highest revenue?
* Which marketing channels perform best?
* Where do customers drop off in the conversion funnel?
* Which customer segments are most valuable?
* How effective are A/B test variations?
* How can analytical pipelines scale efficiently as data volume grows?

## Data Model

### Dimensions

* dim_customers
* dim_products
* dim_campaigns

### Facts

* fct_transactions
* fct_events

### Advanced Models

* fct_transactions_incremental
* customer_snapshot

---

## dbt Lineage

The lineage graph below demonstrates how source tables flow through staging, dimensions, facts, snapshots, and business marts.

## Analytics Engineering Implementation

### Staging Models

Raw source data is standardized and cleaned through dedicated staging models.

* stg_transactions
* stg_customers
* stg_products
* stg_campaigns
* stg_events

### Dimension Models

Business entities are modeled using dimension tables.

* dim_customers
* dim_products
* dim_campaigns

### Fact Models

Business events are modeled using fact tables.

* fct_transactions
* fct_events

### Business Marts

The platform provides business-ready marts for reporting and analytics.

* mart_sales_summary
* mart_campaign_performance
* mart_customer_analytics
* mart_conversion_funnel
* mart_ab_test_performance
* mart_customer_cohort_retention

---

## Incremental Processing

A dedicated incremental model was implemented to process only newly arrived transaction data rather than rebuilding the full dataset.

### Benefits

* Faster execution
* Reduced BigQuery processing costs
* Improved scalability
* Production-oriented architecture

### Example

```sql
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='transaction_id'
) }}

SELECT *
FROM {{ source('marketing_analytics', 'raw_transactions_incremental') }}

{% if is_incremental() %}

WHERE timestamp >
(
    SELECT MAX(timestamp)
    FROM {{ this }}
)

{% endif %}
```

---

## Historical Snapshots

A dbt snapshot was implemented to preserve historical customer state.

Snapshot:

```text
customer_snapshot
```

This enables:

* Historical customer analysis
* Change tracking
* Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2) style reporting

### Snapshot Example

```sql
{% snapshot customer_snapshot %}

{{
config(
    unique_key='customer_id',
    strategy='check',
    check_cols='all'
)
}}

SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('dim_customers') }}

{% endsnapshot %}
```

---

## Data Quality & Governance

Automated data quality checks were implemented using dbt tests.

### Implemented Tests

* not_null
* unique
* accepted_values
* relationships

These tests help ensure data reliability and analytical trustworthiness.

## AI Executive Reporting

An AI reporting layer was built using Python and OpenRouter.

The workflow:

1. Query business marts from BigQuery
2. Aggregate business KPIs
3. Build structured business context
4. Send context to an LLM
5. Generate executive-level business insights

Generated reports include:

* Executive Summary
* Sales Performance Analysis
* Marketing Analysis
* Funnel Analysis
* Experiment Evaluation
* Strategic Recommendations
* Risks & Opportunities

This demonstrates how traditional analytics platforms can be enhanced using Generative AI.
